# Alternative Systems

If you're not happy with Void, you can always choose something other — there are many Linux-based and other Unix-like systems that are available for free. This section describes some popular options.

## Debian Family

[**Debian**](https://www.debian.org/) is one of main significant Linux distributions — popular and universal, it has plenty of forks, including Ubuntu and Linux Mint. However, there are other options also.

[**Ubuntu**](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is one of most well-known Debian-based Linux distributions. Back to the old days it was really good choice for Linux beginners because of wide human-oriented community, tons of "X for Dummy"-like guidelines, easy auto-installer and so on. At these days it's not only Ubuntu features, but many other distributions.

There are at least two of significant Ubuntu-based distributions, both with own philosophy, interfaces, default applications set and other:

  - [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)
  - [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/)

Another option is so-called "Ubuntu Flavours", which is actually Ubuntu just with another pre-installed graphical interface (desktop environment more precisely):

  - [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) with Xfce 4 desktop environment which is good for old not-so-fast PCs.
  - [Kubuntu](https://www.kubuntu.org/) with KDE feature-rich desktop environment.
  - [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/) with LXDE light desktop environment. It's more like Xfce 4, but not so mature for now.
  - [Ubuntu GNOME](https://ubuntugnome.org/) with GNOME 3 desktop environment. GNOME 3 is the one of most popular desktop environments like KDE.
  - [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) with MATE desktop environment which is actually fork of old GNOME 2. GNOME 2 was more or less like Windows 7 desktops back to its days.
  - [Ubuntu Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/) with Budgie modern desktop environment. Budgie desktop is more like improved GNOME 3 which on it's actually based.

As *universal* operating system, Debian became the base for special privacy and security-aimed distributions not for daily home usage:

  - [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) is the most famous distribution designed for system or networking security-related tests.
  - [Parrot](https://parrotsec.org/) is another option for penetration testing and reverse engineering.
  - [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) is preconfigured with anonymity and security in the mind, made for cases when you need to hide something... from someone.

## Fedora Family

[**Fedora**](https://getfedora.org/) is another popular general-purpose Linux distribution mainly curated by Red Hat corporation. Not as popular as Debian or its forks, it generally provides more fresh (but sometimes less stable) software packages.

There are at least four significant projects that based on (or shares) Fedora recources:

  - [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) — sometimes treated as "commercial version of Fedora"
  - [Cent OS](https://www.centos.org/), also known as Communuty Enterprise Operating System
  - [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
  - [Korora Project](https://kororaproject.org/)

## Arch Linux Family

[**Arch Linux**](https://www.archlinux.org/) is another general purpose distribution, designed primarily for advanced users. Main features of Arch family are *bleeding-edge* software packages (novelty is preferred over stability, avoiding excesses however) and overall system minimalism. Arch family distributions may be cool for Linux studying or home usage by power users but they're definitely not recommended e.g. for production servers. Without properly configuration it may become way too unstable comparing to Debian e.g.

You should also consider that original Arch Linux currently not provides an installer (altrough some other Arch-based distributions does) so you'll probably need to read some manuals on ArchWiki and install Arch manually.

  - [Parabola GNU/Linux-libre](https://www.parabola.nu/)
  - [ArchBang Linux](https://www.archbang.org/)
  - [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
  - [Antergos](https://antergos.com/)

## Gentoo Family

[**Gentoo**](https://gentoo.org/) is one of most advanced duistributions with source-based packages distribution model which means that user should compile the whole system manually (not relying on third-party builders). As a result, one can reach better performance by compiling executables that uses all the features of target processor — however, I should warn you that performance boost won't be as notable as you might think.

  - [Sabayon](https://www.sabayon.org/)
  - [Exherbo](https://exherbo.org/)
  - [Funtoo Linux](https://www.funtoo.org/)

## Independent Distributions

There are many other Linux distributions written from scratch but not as popular as previously discussed.

  - [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/)
  - [GoboLinux](https://www.gobolinux.org/)
  - [GuixSD](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/)
  - [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
  - [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
  - [Puppy Linux](https://puppylinux.com/)
  - [Slackware Linux](https://www.slackware.com/)
  - [Void Linux](https://www.voidlinux.eu/) — yay, Void! Linux distribution which this guide is dedicated to.

If you're really interested, there are also special [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) project. Unlike others, it does not provide some software, even not a source codes but just a set of human-oriented instructions instead. Following LFS, you should manually obtain original source code and complie it — kernel, core utilities, shell, anything you need.

## BSD Family and Other Unix-like

You can choose some BSD-based system if you prefer something Unix-like except Linux. However, I should warn you that these options are mostly for advanced users.

[**FreeBSD**](https://www.freebsd.org/) — Unix-like operating system derivated from original BSD code. Currently has some forks:

  - [TrueOS](https://www.trueos.org/), formerly known as PCBSD
  - [GhostBSD](https://www.ghostbsd.org/)
  - [DragonFly BSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/)

There are some other independent BSD forks not as popular as FreeBSD:

  - [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/)
  - [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/)

You can also try [Redox OS](https://www.redox-os.org/) — not BSD-like, but Unix-like modern operating system written in Rust programming language. Currently under heavy development and experimental, so mostly probably not for home usage.

## Not Unix at All

  - [ReactOS](https://www.reactos.org/) one of most successful attempts to rewrite Windows-like operating system, currently under development and still lacks of some vital features like USB 3.0, but works in some cases.
  - [MenuetOS](https://menuetos.net/)
  - [KolibriOS](https://kolibrios.org/en/)
  - [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/)

## Which One Should I Choose?

Any option is good, just stick with one until it suits your needs and does not make a troubles you can't handle.
