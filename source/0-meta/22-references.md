## Documentation, Guides, Manuals and Wikis

  - [Void Linux Packages Search](https://www.voidlinux.eu/packages/) — just another way to search packages if you're unable use the `xbps-query -Rs [package]` command by some reason.
  - [Void Linux Packages Repository](https://repo.voidlinux.eu/) — main place where all the official packages (see the `current` directory) and some other stuff like live images are stored.
  - [Void Linix Wiki](https://wiki.voidlinux.eu/) — wiki with some Void-specific articles.

Void Linux wiki is still too small for now, so you'll probably need to consult the other sources. Try other distributions wikis for instance:

  - [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/)
  - [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/)
  - [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)

Despite these wikis are dedicated to corresponding Linux distributions, most of its guides and manuals are suitable for any Linux distribution, including Void. Another option is common Linux sites:

  - [TLDR Pages](https://tldr.sh/) — simplified and shortened manuals for typical Linux components, mostly software e.g. Tar, Wget and so on. Sometimes it saves the day, sometimes not.
  - [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) — nice and simple compilation of basic Linux stuff (e.g. command line, user management, networking etc.) Great for novice, but almost useless for advanced user; and, unfortunately, doesn't cover the Linux installation steps (yet?).
  - [The Linux Information Project](https://www.linfo.org/) — series of old general Linux articles. Nice, cozy and quiet, this site still rocking nowdays. Don't think it's really obsolete, most of site contents are actual even for today. (*Last update circa 2007*)
  - [The Linux Documentation Project](https://www.tldp.org/) — hardcore option, this site includes **TONS** of verbose Linux-related info. Better for advanced user who know what he (or she) need.
  - [Grymoire](https://www.grymoire.com/) — a little strange yet useful site with detailed guides to Awk, Sed, Grep, Tar and some other classic Linux components.

## Communities

### Void Linux General

  - [Void Linux Forum](https://forum.voidlinux.eu/) — main place to discuss the Void and related.
  - [Void Linux on GitHub](https://github.com/voidlinux) — part of Void infrastructure, hosted (or mirrored) on GitHub. Take a look at [voidlinux/void-packages](https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages) – it's currently the best place where you can file a bug report or leave package request.
  - [Void Linux Buildbot](https://build.voidlinux.eu/) — this thing compiles new versions of all the Void packages. Check out the [waterfall](https://build.voidlinux.eu/waterfall), it shows building progress *in live*.

### Reddit

Sub[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)s, of course! Many of them, here are some:

  - [/r/voidlinux](https://www.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/) – for Void.
  - [/r/linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/) – for common Linux.
  - [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) – Unix and Unix-like system visual customization.
  - [/r/linuxmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/) – Linux-related humor, if you prefer. There are many subs like that actually.

### Stackexchange

Sites like well-known [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) – sometimes the best way to find the solution, fix the problem, or help other people. Check out these:

  - [Super User](https://superuser.com/) — generaly for all the PC software stuff and contains mostly Microsoft® Windows® and Apple® macOS® questions, but Linux too.
  - [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/) — designed primarily for Ubuntu users, but contains lots of common Linux newbie-friendly solutions (I personally don't recommend you to overuse these).
  - [Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/) — for general Linux questions.
  - [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/) — for system and network administrators, as it states.

### Other

  - [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/) — "crowdsourced software recommendations" as it states – good place to find alternatives for software and some web services, especially when you moving on Linux.
  - [Slant](https://www.slant.co/) — actually neither Void nor Linux site, but contains a lots of comparisons for Unix-like software. Good thing when you need to make the decision.

## Books

There are many of good Linux books actually, but these ones are also free (at least you can read the full e-copy legally):

  - ["Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous"](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) — Unix and Unix-like command line tutorial book written by Michael Hartl. Includes mostly basic command line tips and tricks, this would be great for Linux beginner.
  - ["The Linux Command Line"](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) — another way to learn the command line and shell (Bash for this case) by William Shotts. Really huge and verbose thing actually, I think it's better for advanced users.
  - ["Linux Sea"](https://swift.siphos.be/linux_sea/) — an introduction to the Linux as an operating system, nice and detailed book by Sven Vermeulen. While book is using Gentoo Linux advanced distribution as an example, it would be very helpful for any Linux distribution user, including Void.
