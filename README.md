# Linux Guides

Detailed yet simple guides to Linux operating system and related software. I've started to write this during my migration from Microsoft® Windows® to some Linux distributions — it was very important to keep so many things in mind. One can use these guides, but I personally recommend to look into reference links instead, this might me much more useful and reliable, espeially if you're completely new to Linux.
